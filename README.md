# Predict Stock Market Prices

## Inspiration
Help investors with stock market investments.

## What it does
Predict the stock price (in 2 weeks) of a given ticker symbol.

## How I built it
I used Python to build a neural network in TensorFlow and Keras.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The machine learning model seems to make reasonable predictions on stock market prices. So, that's definitely a plus.

## What's next 
Make the prediction model more robust by improving its accuracy.
